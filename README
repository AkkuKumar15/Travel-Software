# Calendar-Aware Flight Planner (Experimental)

This project explores **calendar-aware flight planning** by filtering flight
options based on real Google Calendar constraints. Instead of choosing flights
first and fitting life around them, this tool treats your schedule as a
first-class input.

The UI is built with Streamlit and integrates:
- Google Flights (via SerpAPI)
- Google Calendar (OAuth)
- Dynamic filtering based on activities

⚠️ This is an experimental project, not a production booking tool.

## How it works (high level)

1. Flights are fetched from Google Flights using SerpAPI
2. Your Google Calendar is queried for activities on relevant travel days
3. Flights are filtered:
   - Outbound flights must arrive **before** the first activity
   - Inbound flights must depart **after** the last activity
4. A Streamlit UI lets you cycle through valid options
5. Selected flights are previewed directly on your calendar

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- A SerpAPI account and API key
- A Google Cloud project with:
  - Google Calendar API enabled
  - OAuth client credentials

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

'''bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Travel-Software.git
cd Travel-Software

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

### 3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Configure SerpAPI

Get your SerpAPI key from https://serpapi.com/google-flights-api

Then add it to your environment:

export SERPAPI_KEY="your_api_key_here"

### 5. Configure Google Calendar OAuth

a. Create OAuth credentials

- Go to Google Cloud Console

- Enable Google Calendar API

- Create OAuth client credentials

- Download the credentials JSON file

b. Add credentials to the project

Rename the downloaded file to:

credentials.json

and place it in the project root directoy

⚠️ This file should not be committed to GitHub.

### 6. Choose the calendar to use

Create a file named:

travel_calendar_id.txt

with a single line containing the calendar ID to query.

You can find the calendar ID by going to https://calendar.google.com/ -> My calendars -> Hover over one of the calendars and press the 3 dots -> Settings and Sharing -> Scroll down to "Calendar ID", which will be a super long piece of text ending with @group.calendar.google.com

### 7. Run the streamlit app:

python -m streamlit run plan_trip.py

On first run:
- A browser window will open for Google authentication
- A local token.json file will be created automatically

⚠️ token.json contains OAuth access and refresh tokens and must never be committed to GitHub.
